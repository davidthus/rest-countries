# REST COUNTRIES

This app allows you to:
 - View all of the countries in the world on the home page
 - Search for countries based in a specific region or with a specific name
 - Click on a country and view its details
 - Be able to toggle light and dark mode
 - Within a country's page, click on its border countries to be redirected to their pages
 
For this project I used:
- Nextjs
- styled-components

This was my first time trying to use lazy loading for components but I think it made the app slower, how sad.
